<h2><b>WHAT WE LEARNED TODAY</b></h2>
<br>
<p>After reviewing this chapter we learned that the sensorimotor representation is highly variable between individuals. 
 Therefore, functional mappping may show that the motor and sensory representation is not as in the textbook (we see
 this frequently with TMS maps). Additionally, the sensorimotor primary and secondary areas are highly connected, so
 they function more as a network than as isolated regions with rigid unique functions.<br>
 There are multiple seizure semiologies coming from the sensorimotor areas including spasms, complex posturing, vocalization,
 speech arrest, sensory symptoms, eye and head deviation,... which are not the textbook focal seizure with Jacksonian march. <br>
 To make things even more complicated, some motor seizures coming from the sensorimotor area are not detected on
 scalp EEG.<br>
 Therefore, as the chapter says, both ictal symptomatology and scalp EEG may be misleading in identifying the central region
 as the region of seizure onset. Additionally, lateralization may be also misleading because of the rapid contralateral
 spread.<br>
 When there a lesion which is well demarcated and there is little risk of functional deficit and lateralization
 of seizures is concordant, go for single stage resection. Otherwise, sEEG.<br>
 Large lesions like polymicrogyrias or encephalomalacias can have epileptogenic areas and quiet areas. Therefore,
 sEEG may be able to make a patient with a large "inoperable" lesion able to take out the seizure onset zone while
 sparing functional areas.<br>
 Radiofrequency thermocoagulation is an alternative when the lesion or area of interest is too entrenched with
 critical functional areas, so we reduce the lesion mass and hope that it works.</p>
